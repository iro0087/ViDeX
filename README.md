# ViDeX
Convert a video to pdf and create a tex file with the frames of the video in the background.

You can also choose a new framerate for the video to have a faster "pdflatex -halt-on-error edit.tex" compilation.

Maybe that your compiled pdf will show about a quarter of each frame in the background, so make sure to compile twice.
